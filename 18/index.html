    I looked at gmail and it's hard to say with any certainty what anything 
    is as there are very criptic names for things. One intersting thing I noticed is the use of 
    JSON arrays insted of objects in request and response bodies. This makes it impossible to discern
    what inforation is being sent and recieved and this is likely the reason too. A more obvious 
    thing to note is a regularly called GET https://mail.google.com/sync/... which is likely syncing 
    the mail box.
